Exception in JAVA
* Exception is an unexpected problem that occurs during runtime.
* Exception occurs only during abnormal situations.
* Every exception in java is an inbuilt subclass of java.lang.throwable.

* Exception Handling is a mechanism of executing a program normally even incase of exception.
* Exception can be handled by using try and catch block.

  syntax:
          try{
                //risky code
                //instructions dependent on risky code
             }
          catch (Throwable var)
              {
                 //message
              }
